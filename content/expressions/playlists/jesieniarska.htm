<p>
  Fall is my favourite season, not least because the mood outside fits most of
  my music collection.
</p>

<p>
  I created this playlist on a sunny autumn day and a less sunny afternoon,
  collecting music I had been enjoying in autumn for the past 5 years or so.
</p>

<p>
  The playlist is not "curated" or "composed" or anything of that kind. It is
  more of a log of what music I was revisiting that day. Progressions of songs
  are genuine first thoughts even if they don't make much sense.
</p>

<p>
  A note on the name: it means "the autumn-fan playlist", mixing Swedish and
  Polish words. It's a small word play exercising similarities of the
  declension of adjectives between these languages.
